# JAVA_Quiz_7
1. What is a programming language? What is JAVA and what is JAVA used for?
>Ans: Programming language: programming language is a type of language that is used to communicate with computers to build an application. It is a machine readable language or instraction.
JAVA: JAVA is an object oriented programming language. JAVA code is typically compiled into bytecode, that can run on any computer or device that has a JAVA Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. 
JAVA is known for its simplicity, readability, and reliability, and is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software development. It is also the primary language used for developing Android mobile applications.

2. Which version of JAVA you are working with? How can you find out the version of JAVA you are using?
>Ans: JAVA(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_371-b11)
JAVA HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.371-b11, mixed mode)
Execute the command "JAVA -version" in git terminal, it will show the current version installed in the machine. 

3. What is IDE? Which IDE you are working with?
>Ans: IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides a comprehensive development environment for programmers to write, test, and debug code. IDEs typically include a source code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and tools for debugging and testing code. Some popular IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, Visual Studio etc.

>IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3.2 (Community Edition)

4. What is source code? What is file extension for JAVA source code?
>Ans: Source code refers to the set of instructions or statements written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is the human-readable form of a computer program that is used by programmers to develop and maintain software applications. The file extension for JAVA source code is ".JAVA".

5. What is the second stage of JAVA life cycle?
>Ans: The second stage of JAVA life cycle is "Compiler". The JAVA compiler reads the source code in a ".JAVA" file and produces bytecode or compile code in a ".class" file, that can be executed by the JAVA Virtual Machine (JVM).

6. Which compiler is used for compiling JAVA file?
>Ans: The JAVA compiler, also known as "JAVAc", is used for compiling JAVA files.
JAVA compiler transform from human-readable source code into bytecode, which is a program that can be executed by the JAVA Virtual Machine (JVM). 

7. What files are the input and output of the compilation stage?
>Ans: input of the compilation stage: .JAVA
and output of the compilation stage: .class

8. Which command is used to call JAVA compiler in terminal or CMD?
>Ans: terminal: JAVAc,  CMD: JAVAc.exe

9. What is the third stage of JAVA Life Cycle?
>Ans: Third stage of JAVA Life Cycle is JVM or JAVA Virtual Machine. 
When a JAVA program is executed, the JVM reads the compiled bytecode instructions from the program's class files, interprets them, and executes them. The JVM also manages memory allocation and deallocation, performs garbage collection to reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer needed, and provides other runtime services such as security, class loading, and exception handling.

10. At which stage class loader is used and what function does it perform?
>Ans: Class loaders are used during the runtime of a JAVA program to dynamically load JAVA classes into the JVM. 

 Second part:
1. What is the syntax? Make a list of rules(you learned in a class) you should always follow while creating your JAVA application.
>Ans: Syntax in Java refers to the set of rules and principles that define the structure and format of the Java programming language. These rules determine how Java code should be written, organized, and formatted in order to be valid and understandable by the Java compiler
List of Syntax I learned-
a. The "class" keyword followed by the name of the class.
b. A set of curly braces that enclose the class body.
c. Statements in Java must end with a semicolon (;).
d. Comments can be added to Java code using the // syntax.
e. JAVA variables must be declared with a data type. Examples includes -  
	int, 
	char,
	double, 
	boolean, 
	String, before they can be used.
f. JAVA has a set of reserved keywords, Examples includes -
	"public", 
	"static", and 
	"void", that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers.
g. JAVA is a case-sensitive language


2. How should we name our JAVA application?
>Ans: We should choose a name that reflects the purpose of the application. We should keep it simple but use a descriptive words. Before we save, we should check for the availibility. 

3. Write a structure of a simple JAVA application.
>Ans: Structure of a simple JAVA application should be as followes:
a. Define the main class.
b. Declare variables.
c. Initialize the variables
d. Write the application logic
e. Add input/output as needed, to allow the user to input data and to display output from the application.
f. Compile the code
g. Execute the code

4. What is file extension for JAVA executable code? At which stage of JAVA Life Cycle we get executable code?
>Ans: The file extension for Java executable code is ".class". 
The stage of the JAVA life cycle at which we get executable code is the "Compile" stage. This is the stage where the JAVA source code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by JAVA Vertual Machine (JVM). 

5. When does compile time starts?
>Ans: When I save my code in the IDE, it automatically invokes the compiler in the background to compile your code.
The compile time in JAVA starts when I initiate the process of compiling my JAVA code, either through a command-line interface or an IDE.

6. Compile time ends with generation of which file?
>Ans: The compile time in Java ends with the generation of ".class" files. 

7. Can you run the program without compilation? Try running your first program without compilation and share the result.
>Ans: No, I cannot run a JAVA program without compilation.
If I run a program "class HelloWorld" without compilation, I get this error:
Error: Could not find or load main class HelloWorld

8. Create a JAVA Project using IntelliJ
i. Create 2 JAVA classes with main method and printing some message.
>Ans: Class 1: 
public class Quiz781 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Print this message: " + "Welcome to JAVA");
    }
}

>Ans:Class 2:
public class Quiz7811 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Print this message: " + "Welcome to JAVA");
    }
}

ii. Create 1 JAVA class with main method and print message “I will practice JAVA day and night” and single line comments explaining each line of your code.
>Ans: 
public class Quiz782 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    //print message “I will practice JAVA day and night”
        System.out.println("Print this message: " + "I will practice JAVA day and night");
    }
}

iii. Create 1 JAVA class with main method, print message “I will be JAVA Hero one day” and multi-         line comment explaining each line of your code.
>Ans:
//creating a class as Quiz783
public class Quiz783 {
        // creating main method
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            //printing  message “I will practice JAVA day and night”
            System.out.println("Print this message: " + "I will be JAVA Hero one day");
        }
    }

iv. Create JAVA class JAVAQuiz with main method and take input for studentName, studentEmail, quizNumber using scanner class and print these.



v. Write a simple JAVA program to print the “I am JAVA Expert” message. Keeping in mind stages of JAVA Life Cycle draw a flow chart to show journey of your program.
>Ans: 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("I am JAVA Expert");
    }
}
